# Module 1 Reflections

## Reflection 1

### Applied Principles
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each class has a single, well-defined purpose
   - Clear separation between controllers, services, and repositories

2. **Interface Segregation**
   - Services defined through interfaces
   - Clear API contracts between layers

3. **Dependency Injection**
   - Spring's @Autowired for loose coupling
   - Easy to test and modify components

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Input Validation**
   - Need to add proper validation for product creation/updates
   - Implement form validation on both client and server side
   - Implementing a client and server side in general

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement global exception handling
   - Create custom error pages

3. **Security**
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Implement input sanitization
   - Consider adding authentication

## Reflection 2

How do i feel in this reflection? defeated :(

### Unit Testing Insights
1. **Test Coverage Considerations**
   - While achieving 100% code coverage is valuable, it doesn't guarantee bug-free code
   - Coverage helps identify untested code paths but doesn't ensure all logical cases are tested
   - Our [`ProductServiceImplTest`](src/test/java/id/ac/ui/cs/advprog/eshop/service/ProductServiceImplTest.java) covers basic CRUD operations but could be expanded for edge cases

2. **Quality vs Quantity**
   - Unit tests should focus on testing meaningful scenarios rather than hitting an arbitrary number
   - Each test method should verify a specific behavior or use case
   - Current implementation includes positive and negative scenarios for product operations

3. **Test Organization**
   - Tests are organized following the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - Clear test method naming helps understand test purposes
   - Separate test classes for different components (Service, Repository, Controller)

### Functional Testing Improvements
1. **Code Duplication Issues**
   - Common setup code repeated across [`CreateProductFunctionalTest`](src/test/java/id/ac/ui/cs/advprog/eshop/functional/CreateProductFunctionalTest.java) and [`HomePageFunctionalTest`](src/test/java/id/ac/ui/cs/advprog/eshop/functional/HomePageFunctionalTest.java)
   - Similar instance variables and `@BeforeEach` methods duplicated

2. **Suggested Improvements**
   - Create a base functional test class with common setup code
   - Extract shared URL formatting logic
   - Use test fixtures for common test data
   - Example structure:
     ```java
     @TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)
     abstract class BaseFunctionalTest {
         @LocalServerPort
         protected int serverPort;
         
         @Value("${app.baseUrl:http://localhost}")
         protected String baseUrl;
         
         protected String createUrl(String path) {
             return String.format("%s:%d%s", baseUrl, serverPort, path);
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Benefits of Refactoring**
   - Reduced code duplication
   - Easier maintenance
   - More consistent testing approach
   - Better test organization

### Lessons Learned
1. High code coverage should not be the only goal of testing
2. Tests should be treated with the same code quality standards as production code
3. Regular refactoring of test code is important to maintain cleanliness
4. A good balance between unit and functional tests helps ensure application quality

## Reflection

### Code Quality Issues and Fixes

1. **SonarCloud Analysis Issues**
   - Implemented proper test coverage for CRUD operations in [`ProductRepositoryTest`](src/test/java/id/ac/ui/cs/advprog/eshop/repository/ProductRepositoryTest.java)
   - Added comprehensive test cases including positive and negative scenarios
   - Fixed code duplication in functional tests by following the suggested base test class pattern

2. **Docker Build Configuration**
   - Fixed permission issues with gradlew execution by adding `RUN chmod +x gradlew` in [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)
   - Implemented proper multi-stage build to reduce final image size
   - Configured correct working directory and file paths for the build process

### CI/CD Implementation Analysis

The current implementation meets the definition of CI/CD for the following reasons:

1. **Continuous Integration**
   - Automated test execution through GitHub Actions workflow in [sonarcloud.yml](.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml)
   - Code quality checks using SonarCloud analysis
   - Immediate feedback on code quality and test results after each push

2. **Continuous Deployment**
   - Automated deployment to Koyeb PaaS platform
   - Docker container build and deployment on successful CI checks
   - Zero-touch deployment process from commit to production

3. **Quality Gates**
   - Code analysis through [scorecard.yml](.github/workflows/scorecard.yml) for security checks
   - Unit and functional tests run before deployment
   - Automated quality checks ensure only verified code reaches production

# Module 3 Reflections

## 1) Principles Applied to the Project

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**  
  Each class in the project has one well-defined responsibility. For example, our controllers (e.g. [`ProductController`](src/main/java/id/ac/ui/cs/advprog/eshop/controller/ProductController.java)) only handle incoming HTTP requests and delegate business logic to services, while repositories (e.g. [`ProductRepository`](src/main/java/id/ac/ui/cs/advprog/eshop/repository/ProductRepository.java)) are solely responsible for data access.

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**  
  The design is open for extension but closed for modification. Service interfaces (such as [`ProductService`](src/main/java/id/ac/ui/cs/advprog/eshop/service/ProductService.java)) allow us to introduce new implementations without altering the existing tested code.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**  
  Although not fully implemented yet, our models for different domain objects (e.g. Product and Car) can be refactored to implement a common interface. This will allow any instance of a subclass (or implementing type) to replace an instance of a base type without affecting program correctness.

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**  
  Our service interfaces are focused and concise. For example, [`ProductService`](src/main/java/id/ac/ui/cs/advprog/eshop/service/ProductService.java) only contains the methods needed for product operations, keeping clients from being forced to depend on unused functionality.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**  
  High-level modules (like controllers) depend on abstractions rather than on concrete implementations. Springâ€™s dependency injection (using `@Autowired`) ensures that controllers depend on service interfaces, which makes the application more decoupled and testable.

## 2) Advantages of Applying SOLID Principles

- **Enhanced Maintainability:**  
  When, for example, the database implementation requires a change, only the repository layer needs modification. The controllers and services remain untouched because each layer has its own responsibility.
  ```java
  @Repository
  public class ProductRepository { ... }

- **Improved Testability**
  Dependency injection and the use of interfaces make it simple to mock or stub dependencies during unit tests.
  ```java
  @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
   class ProductServiceImplTest {
      @Mock
      private ProductRepository productRepository;
      
      @InjectMocks
      private ProductServiceImpl productService;
      
      // Testing can focus solely on business logic without needing a real repository implementation.
   }

-**Flexibility for Extensions**
  New features, such as adding a new kind of product or service, can be introduced by creating new classes that extend the existing abstractions. The overall system architecture remains robust because existing code need not be changed.

## 3) Disadvantages of Not Applying SOLID Principles

- **Code Duplication and Rigidity:**
  Without proper abstractions, similar logic often gets duplicated. For example, if both ProductRepository and CarRepository were implemented without a common abstraction, changes such as bug fixes would need to be applied in multiple places.

- **Inflexible Architecture:**
  Failing to adhere to OCP means that even small changes (like adding a new product type) force modifications in existing methods. This can introduce bugs and make it harder to scale the application over time.
