## Code Quality & Clean Code Principles

### Applied Principles
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each class has a single, well-defined purpose
   - Clear separation between controllers, services, and repositories

2. **Interface Segregation**
   - Services defined through interfaces
   - Clear API contracts between layers

3. **Dependency Injection**
   - Spring's @Autowired for loose coupling
   - Easy to test and modify components

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Input Validation**
   - Need to add proper validation for product creation/updates
   - Implement form validation on both client and server side
   - Implementing a client and server side in general

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement global exception handling
   - Create custom error pages

3. **Security**
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Implement input sanitization
   - Consider adding authentication
